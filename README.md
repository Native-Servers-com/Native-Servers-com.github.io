[Wie kann ich Inhalte verfassen?](https://community.native-servers.com/how-to-contribute)


This website is built by the Native-Servers.com-Team using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

### Installation of locally needed software

You need to download the latest release of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Please make sure to allow Node.js to install Chocolatey for easy installation of needed dependencies.

### Local Development

Add the Repo to your GitHub Desktop or CLI to fetch the latest Build of the Wiki.

To locally run the application after fetching run following command


```
$ npm run
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory. Go back to the GitHub Application commit & push your changes to the repo and let github build the website (aprox. 15 seconds). The changes should be now visible to everyone.
